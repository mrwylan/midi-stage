# MIDI Router Web Application

This project is a browser-based application for musicians to configure and manage their MIDI equipment. It provides a powerful, flexible workflow separated into three distinct perspectives: **Setup**, **Studio**, and **Stage**.

Users can define a library of their instruments, visually route MIDI signals in a node-based editor, and create custom touch-friendly control surfaces for live performance.
