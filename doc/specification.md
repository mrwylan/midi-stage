As a musician, I want to...

## Device Management
*   ...see a list of all my connected MIDI devices so that I can get an overview of my setup.
*   ...be able to add a new MIDI device to the application so that I can incorporate it into my routing.
*   ...be able to remove a MIDI device from the application so that I can manage my device list.
*   ...be able to give custom names to my MIDI devices so that I can easily identify them.

## Visual Routing
*   ...be able to see a visual representation of my MIDI devices and their connections so that I can understand the signal flow.
*   ...be able to connect the MIDI output of one device to the MIDI input of another device by dragging a line between them.
*   ...be able to disconnect a MIDI routing by deleting the connection line.

## MIDI Filtering and Mapping
*   ...be able to filter out specific MIDI message types (e.g., Note On/Off, CC) on a specific channel for a given connection so that I can control what data is sent.
*   ...be able to remap a MIDI message from one type to another (e.g., a CC message to a Program Change) so that I can create custom control setups.

## Presets
*   ...be able to save my entire MIDI routing configuration as a preset so that I can recall it later.
*   ...be able to load a previously saved preset so that I can quickly switch between different setups.
*   ...be able to give my presets custom names so that I can easily organize them.

## Real-time Monitoring
*   ...be able to see a real-time log of all MIDI messages flowing through the system so that I can debug my setup.
*   ...be able to filter the MIDI log to only show messages from specific devices or channels so that I can focus on what's important.
